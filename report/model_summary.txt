Model: RandomForestRegressor
Best Parameters: n_estimators = 300, random_state = 42
Dataset Used: Scaled (with outliers)

Evaluation Metrics:
- RMSE: 0.003489
- RÂ² Score: 0.999977

Remarks:
This model performed the best across all tested combinations. Scaling the data improved performance significantly, and removing outliers had little impact due to Random Forest's robustness.
